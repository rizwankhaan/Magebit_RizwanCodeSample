# Magebit_RizwanCodeSample module
# Developed by Rizwan Khan

This is a custom Magento 2 module designed to enhance product pages by allowing customers to submit inquiries about products. The module integrates with the Magento backend and frontend, providing a user-friendly experience for both customers and administrators.

Key Features
1. Product Inquiry Tab: Adds a dedicated tab on the product view page where customers can submit inquiries.

2. Admin Grid: All submitted inquiries are visible in the Magento backend, allowing admins to manage and view customer queries efficiently.

3. Enable/Disable Functionality: The module can be easily enabled or disabled via the Magento configuration under Store -> Configuration -> Magebit -> General Configuration For Inquiry Form.

4. Frontend Form: The inquiry form is built using Tailwind CSS, ensuring a modern and responsive design. While I have not worked extensively with the Hyva theme due to limited documentation and licensing constraints, I ensured the form aligns with modern styling practices.

5. Extensible Design: The module is designed with scalability in mind. Although a reply-to-inquiry feature was not implemented due to time constraints, the architecture allows for easy integration of this functionality in the future.

# Future Improvements

1. Implement a reply-to-inquiry feature from the edit/view inquiry, allowing admins to respond to customer inquiries directly from the backend.

2. Enhance the module with additional customization options, such as form field configuration and email template customization.
